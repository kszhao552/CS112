This is the collection of the coded problem sets throughout the semseter from BU's CS 112 Intro to CS II (Data Structures).
The course was taken in the second semester of my freshman year. 

The third problem set did not have any coded portions so they do not have a folder for the assignments.
The fourth problem set contains a sudoku solver with puzzle1.txt and puzzle2.txt being examples of how it works. For the program to be able to read the puzzles, they must be placed inside the root folder. If you wish to create your own puzzle to test, the format should follow the example puzzles where each number is seperated by a space and empty spaces are 0's.
